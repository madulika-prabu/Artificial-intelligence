    "eliminate the exponent, but we can cut it into half.Hence there is a technique by which without checking each node of the game tree\n",
    "we can compute the correct minimax decision, and this technique is called pruning. This involves two threshold parameter. Alpha and Beta for future expansion, so it is called alpha-beto pruning. It is i also called as Alpha Beta pruning (Alpha beta algorithm).\n",
    "* Alpha Beta pruning can be applied at any depth of a tree, and sometime it not only prune the tree leaves but also entire sub-tree\n",

    "    o Beta: The best (lowest-valued) choice we have found so for at any point along the path of minimizer. The initial value of beta is +∞\n",
    "* The alpha-beta pruning to a standard minimax algorithm returns the same move as the standard algorithm does, but it removes all the nodes which are not really affecting the final decision but making algorithm show. Hence, by pruning these nodes, it makes the algorithion fast.\n",
